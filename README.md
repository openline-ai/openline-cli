## üëã Overview

This guide will get you up and running with Openline in less than 5 minutes.

The Openline CLI is a NodeJS app that makes it easy to setup and manage Openline apps directly from the terminal. It's an essential part of using Openline.  To develop on the Openline CLI, you'll need [Node.js version 16.14][node] or above installed on your machine.

## üöÄ Installation

Download the Openline CLI using the following command

via brew

```sh-session
brew tap openline-ai/cli
brew install openline
```

via install script

```sh-session
curl http://openline.sh/install.sh | sh
```

You can check that the Openline CLI is properly installed by running

```sh-session
openline --version
```

If everything has been setup correctly, you'll see an output that looks like `openline/x.y.z`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Working locally

Check out our [Guide to Contributing Code][code-guide] for complete step-by-step instructions on how to get setup.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the repo directory
3. run `yarn` to install any missing dependencies
4. run `yarn build` to build the local codebase
5. run `node ./bin/run` to initiate the CLI

üí° Pro Tip:  If you are going to contribute code to this repo, you'll save yourself a ton of time by aliasing the `node ./bin/run` command.  We suggest adding the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```sh-session
alias ol="node {path/to/project/dir}/packages/cli/bin/run"
```

Once aliased, you'll be able to run your local codebase by typing `ol {command}`.
