## üëã Overview

This guide will get you up and running with Openline in less than 5 minutes.

The Openline CLI is a NodeJS app that makes it easy to setup and manage Openline apps directly from the terminal. It's an essential part of using Openline.  To use the Openline CLI, you'll need [Node.js version 16.14][node] or above installed on your machine.

## üöÄ Build and run the CLI using the code in this repo and your local changes

```sh-session
yarn install
yarn build
alias ol="node $(pwd)/bin/run"
ol dev start
```

afterwards you can run the locally build cli by calling "ol"

## üöÄ Installation

Download the Openline CLI using the following command

via npm

```sh-session
npm i openline -g
```

via yarn

```sh-session
yarn add openline
```

You can check that the Openline CLI is properly installed by running

```sh-session
openline --version
```

If everything has been setup correctly, you'll see an output that looks like `openline/x.y.z`.
